**1. Explain the difference between server-side rendering and client-side rendering in React.**

In a React application, there are two main ways to render the components: server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR).

Server-side rendering (SSR) is when the initial render of a React application is done on the server. The server generates the HTML for the initial state of the application and sends it to the browser. When the JavaScript bundle loads, React takes over and the application continues to function as a SPA (Single-Page Application) on the client side.

This approach has a few benefits such as:

Improved performance for search engines and users on slow connections

Faster time-to-first-byte

Better accessibility for users who have JavaScript disabled

Client-side rendering (CSR) is when the React application is rendered entirely in the browser, using JavaScript. The browser requests the JavaScript bundle from the server and then renders the components on the client side. This approach has the benefit of faster load times for users on fast connections and a more responsive user interface.

In general, CSR is the simpler option to implement and more popular, but SSR is a good choice for certain use cases, such as when SEO is a primary concern, or when the app is targeting users on slow internet connections.

It is also worth noting that, it is possible to have a hybrid approach between SSR and CSR which is called isomorphic or universal rendering. This approach allows to leverage the benefits of both SSR and CSR.
